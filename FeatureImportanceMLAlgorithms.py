# 1. Logistic Regression
# 2. Decision Tree - CART Feature Importance
# 3. Random Forest
# 4. Permutation Feature Importance - KNN

# Use Dummy Variables

# 1. Logistic Regression
# logistic regression for feature importance
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# define the model
model = LogisticRegression()
# fit the model
model.fit(X, Y)
# get importance

# 2. Decision Tree
# Decision tree algorithms like classification and regression trees (CART) offer importance scores based on the reduction in the criterion used to select split points, like Gini or entropy.
# After being fit, the model provides a feature_importances_ property that can be accessed to retrieve the relative importance scores for each input feature.
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
# define the model
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
# fit the model
model.fit(X,Y)
# get importance
importance = model.feature_importances_
# summarize feature importance
for i,v in enumerate(importance):
	print('Feature: %0d, Score: %.5f' % (i,v))
# plot feature importance
plt.bar([x for x in range(len(importance))], importance)
plt.show()

# Results
# F0 [Age] - [0.42345]
# F1[Comorbid] - [0.02695]
# F2[Remdesevir] - [0.08221]
# F3[DaysofStay] - [0.30261]
# F4[Covid_Severity] - [0.11269]
# F5[Gender] - [0.05207]
# **Indicates that Age, DaysofStay, Covid_Severity are likely candidates for splitting the decision tree.

# 3. Random Forest Feature Importance
# After being fit, the model provides a feature_importances_ property that can be accessed to retrieve the relative importance scores for each input feature.
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
# define the model
model = RandomForestRegressor()
# fit the model
model.fit(X,Y)
# get importance
importance = model.feature_importances_
# summarize feature importance
for i,v in enumerate(importance):
	print('Feature: %0d, Score: %.5f' % (i,v))
# plot feature importance
plt.bar([x for x in range(len(importance))], importance)
plt.show()

# Results
# F0 [Age] - [0.3960]
# F1[Comorbid] - [0.0425]
# F2[Remdesevir] - [0.04553]
# F3[DaysofStay] - [0.33038]
# F4[Covid_Severity] - [0.1295]
# F5[Gender] - [0.0560]
# **Indicates that Age, DaysofStay, Covid_Severity are likely candidates for splitting the decision tree.
# Results are in-tune with the decision tree approach

# 4. Permutation Feature Importance - using KNN
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.inspection import permutation_importance

# define the model
model = KNeighborsClassifier()
# fit the model
model.fit(X,Y)
# perform permutation importance
results = permutation_importance(model, X, Y, scoring='accuracy')
# get importance
importance = results.importances_mean
# summarize feature importance
for i,v in enumerate(importance):
	print('Feature: %0d, Score: %.5f' % (i,v))
# plot feature importance
plt.bar([x for x in range(len(importance))], importance)
plt.show()

# Results - KNN
# F0 [Age] - [0.08377]
# F1[Comorbid] - [-0.00065]
# F2[Remdesevir] - [0.00162]
# F3[DaysofStay] - [0.05925]
# F4[Covid_Severity] - [0.02655]
# F5[Gender] - [-0.00422]
# **Indicates that Age, DaysofStay, Covid_Severity are likely candidates for splitting the decision tree.
# Results are in-tune with the decision tree approach and Random Forest
